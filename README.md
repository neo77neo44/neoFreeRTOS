# Simulator_Linux:

This is a simulator of freeRTOS in LINUX.

make all/clean are supported. 

Two simple tasks created and send/receive data between them in the example.

Note: please create a directory named "tmp" in root directory before make, otherwise will make failed. I am lazy to auto create a blank "tmp" in Makefile. >_<
